Unlike the container’s ephemeral filesystem, which looses all it’s data when the container is stopped or removed, volumes provide a way to store data outside the container’s lifecycle. Let’s try to understand about Volumes from the creation of a volume to its end.\n\n## How Volumes works and stores the data can be understood in the below 6 pointers:-\n\n## **1. Volume Creation**\n\nWhen a volume is created in Docker it is stored in a specific directory on the **host filesystem**, typically under `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`. Each volume is assigned a unique identifier and can be managed independently of the containers that use it.\n\n```\ndocker volume create my-volume\n```\n\nThis simple command creates a Docker volume named “my-volume”.\n\n## **2. Volume Mounting**\n\nWhen a container is launched, the volume can be mounted to a specific path inside the container’s filesystem. This is done using the `-v` or `--mount` flag in the `docker run` command. The specified path inside the container becomes a link to the volume on the host.  \nTo mount a volume when launching a container, use the `-v` or `--mount` flag:\n\n**Using** `-v`**:**\n\n```\ndocker run -v /host/data:/container/data my-volume\n```\n\n**Using** `--mount`**:**\n\n```\ndocker run --mount type=bind,source=/host/data,target=/container/data my-volume\n```\n\nBoth commands achieve the same result. These commands starts a new Docker container from the image named “my-image,” runs it in the background, and mounts the host directory `/host/data` to the container directory `/container/data`.\n\n## 3. Data Storage\n\nData written to the mounted path inside the container is actually stored in the volume on the host. This means that any changes made to the data within the container are reflected in the volume, and vice versa. The volume acts as a bridge between the container and the host filesystem, allowing for data to remain a persistent storage.\n\n## 4. Isolation and Management\n\nVolumes are managed by Docker, which means they are isolated from the container’s filesystem. This isolation ensures that data remains intact even if the container is stopped, restarted, or even it gets removed. Docker provides commands to create, inspect, list, and remove volumes, allowing for easy management.\n\n## 5. Data Sharing\n\nMultiple containers can mount the same volume, enabling them to share data. This is particularly useful in microservices architectures where different services need to access the same dataset. Docker handles the necessary synchronization and access control.\n\n## 6. Backup and Restore\n\nSince volumes are stored on the host filesystem, they can be easily backed up and restored using standard filesystem tools. This feature is important for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that critical information is not lost.","content_type":"blog","source_url":"https://medium.com/@pranavpurohit73/solving-docker-data-loss-a-guide-to-persistent-storage-with-volumes-bind-mounts-and-tmpfs-93622f4522f2?source=rss-e56284f41ca1------2","author":"","user_id":"","team_id":"team_1"},{"title":"Mastering Docker Networking: From Basics to Advanced","content":"# What is MacVlan Network in Docker Container?\n\nWith Macvlan, Docker assigns a **MAC address** to each container, and your LAN treats it like a separate physical device.\n\nThat means:\n\n* Each container gets its own **unique MAC and IP address** on your physical network.\n* You can ping it from another device on your LAN.\n* No port forwarding or NAT needed.\n\nPerfect if you’re dealing with legacy systems, network appliances, or you want your containers to be indistinguishable from physical servers.\n\n> *🧠 Note: Macvlan also only works on* ***Linux hosts****, and requires you to know your local network setup.*\n\n# Macvlan vs IPvlan\n\nBefore we dive into the hands-on, here’s a quick recap:\n\n* **IPvlan**: Shares host’s MAC address, but gives unique IPs.\n* **Macvlan**: Gives each container **both unique IP and MAC addresses**.\n\nMacvlan is more “visible” to the rest of your LAN.\n\n# Step-by-Step: Setting Up Macvlan\n\n## Step 1: Identify Your Network Interface\n\nSame drill as before:\n\n```\nip a\n```\n\nFind your active interface — often it’s `eth0` or `enp0s3`.\n\n## Step 2: Create the Macvlan Network\n\nHere’s how you do it:\n\n```\ndocker network create -d macvlan \\  \n  --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 \\  \n  --gateway=192.168.1.1 \\  \n  -o parent=eth0 \\  \n  my_macvlan_net\n```\n\nAgain, swap `eth0`, `subnet`, and `gateway` with values that suit your network.\n\n## Step 3: Run a Container in the Macvlan Network\n\n```\ndocker run -dit --name mac1 --network my_macvlan_net alpine\n```\n\nCheck its IP and MAC:\n\n```\ndocker inspect mac1\n```\n\nYou’ll see a new MAC address and a direct IP assigned from your LAN’s range.\n\nTry pinging that IP from another machine on the same network:\n\n```\nping 192.168.1.x\n```\n\nYep, that container behaves like a real host!\n\n## Why to use Macvlan?\n\n* Perfect for network appliances or legacy systems.\n* Gives containers a first-class seat on the LAN.\n* Clean integration without messing with NAT or port mappings.\n\n## Be careful while using Macvlan network because\n\n* Host can’t talk to Macvlan containers by default.\n* Needs careful IP planning.\n* Only works on Linux.\n\n# Summary\n\nMacvlan networks are a great option when you want your containers to be true peers on your network just like VMs or physical machines. With proper setup, it’s plug-and-play for many advanced networking scenarios.\n\n# What is an User-Defined Bridge Network?\n\nYou already know about Docker’s default `bridge` network — the one where every container gets dumped in if you don’t specify a network.\n\nBut when you create your own custom bridge network, Docker unlocks extra features:\n\n* Containers can **talk to each other by name** (automatic DNS).\n* The network is **isolated from the default bridge**.\n* It’s **cleaner and safer** for grouping microservices.\n\n## Why should Create an User-Defined Network?\n\nLet’s say you’re building a mini-app with a frontend and backend. If both are in a user-defined network:\n\n* You don’t need to hardcode IPs.\n* Just use container names to connect them.\n* Docker handles the internal routing for you.\n\n## Step-by-Step guide for creating and using a User-Defined Network\n\n## Step 1: Create the Network\n\nVery simple:\n\n```\ndocker network create my_app_net\n```\n\nYou can inspect it:\n\n```\ndocker network inspect my_app_net\n```\n\nYou’ll see a bridge driver, a subnet, and a gateway created just for this network.\n\n## Step 2: Launch Containers into This Network\n\nLet’s say we have a backend API and a frontend client:\n\n```\ndocker run -dit --name backend --network my_app_net python:3.9-slim\n```\n\n```\ndocker run -dit --name frontend --network my_app_net alpine\n```\n\nNow exec into the frontend:\n\n```\ndocker exec -it frontend sh\n```\n\nTry pinging the backend:\n\n```\nping backend\n```\n\nIt works! DNS resolution is automatic in user-defined networks.\n\n# What About Isolation?\n\nContainers in a user-defined network can’t see containers in another network unless explicitly connected. This makes it perfect for separating services, environments, or tenants.\n\nWant to connect two networks? You can:\n\n```\ndocker network connect my_app_net some_other_container\n```\n\n# How it becomes more useful\n\n* Encourages **modular architecture**.\n* Makes **dev/staging/prod separation** easy.\n* Improves **network security** by reducing noise and cross-talk.\n\n# Wrapping Up\n\nUser-defined bridge networks may not be flashy, but they’re **one of the best practices** you can adopt in Docker today. They’re simple, powerful, and make your containers talk like pros.\n\nNext time, we can combine this with **Docker Compose**, or simulate a microservice architecture using multiple networks.

AWS promised:\n\n* **750 hours** of EC2 every month\n* Free blocks of S3 and EBS storage\n* Free Lambda and DynamoDB calls\n\nI did the math in my head: *31 days × 24 hours = 744*. That’s still under 750. “Great,” I told myself, “a server that can run all year and still have hours to spare!”\n\nSo I launched a **t2.micro** instance, put up a hobby website, and went on with life. A few weeks later an email flashed on my phone:\n\n> ***AWS Billing Alert:*** *You’ve exceeded your Free Tier limits.* ***Amount due:******$42.87***\n\nMy heart sank. I hadn’t created anything fancy — no big databases, no fancy GPU boxes. Why was I being charged?\n\n# Playing Detective in the Billing Console\n\nI dove into the **AWS Billing & Cost Management** screen and looked at every line item. Here’s what I found:\n\nItem Cost What It Was **Data transfer out** ~$30 Visitors to my site used more than 1 GB of outbound traffic. After the first free gigabyte, AWS charges about $0.09 per GB (price varies by region). **NAT Gateway** ~$10 My instance sat in a private subnet. A NAT Gateway spun up so that it could reach the internet for updates. NAT Gateways cost $0.045 per hour plus data fees — over $30 a month if left running. **Odds and ends** ~$2 A detached Elastic IP and some old EBS snapshots I forgot to delete.\n\nThat day I learned a hard truth: **networking, not compute, is what often breaks the “free” promise.**\n\n# The Hidden Fees Everyone Misses\n\nBelow are the four charges that trip new users almost every time. I’m writing them in plain words so you won’t have to learn them the hard way.\n\n## 1. 🌐 Outbound Data Transfer\n\n* **First 1 GB per month is free.**\n* After that, you pay about **$0.09 per GB** in the us-east-1 region. Prices change by region.\n* If your site uses pictures, videos, or an API that returns a lot of JSON, the gigabyte disappears fast. Ten visitors a day can burn through it.\n\n**Tip:** If your project is static (HTML, CSS, images), host it on **S3 + CloudFront**. CloudFront gives 1 TB of data transfer on its own free tier, and it is cheaper after that.\n\n## 2. 🚪 NAT Gateway\n\n* Costs **$0.045 per hour**.\n* That is about **$32 a month** even if no one uses it.\n* There is also a **data processing fee** of $0.045 per GB.\n\n**Why it appears:** When you place EC2 instances in private subnets for security, they can’t hit the internet for updates or package installs. AWS suggests a NAT Gateway by default.\n\n**Cheaper option:** Use a tiny **t3.nano** as a “poor-man’s NAT” (about $3 a month). Or, if the traffic is only for occasional package installs, connect your private subnets to the internet for a few minutes, then shut the NAT down.\n\n## 3. 🧱 Elastic IPs\n\n* An Elastic IP address is **free** while attached to a **running** instance.\n* If the instance stops — or if you keep the IP without attaching it — you pay **$0.005 per hour**. That’s about $3.60 per month *per IP*.\n\n**Tip:** Release Elastic IPs you no longer need. If you must keep a static address, keep the instance running or switch to an **Application Load Balancer** that handles the public address.\n\n## 4. 🗄️ EBS Volumes and Snapshots\n\n* **General Purpose (gp3) EBS** costs about **$0.08 per GB-month**.\n* **Snapshots** cost around **$0.05 per GB-month**.\n\nIt’s easy to spin up test servers, forget them, and let volumes sit there costing money. Snapshots stay even if you delete the AMI that created them.\n\n**Tip:** Tag resources with `Owner=YourName` and run the **AWS Cleanup Dashboard** (in AWS Console → Trusted Advisor → Cost Optimization) once a week.\n\n# Setting Up Shields Before You Launch Anything\n\nBelow is the routine I follow now. It takes less than ten minutes and can save you hundreds of dollars.\n\n## 1. Create a Budget Alarm\n\n1. Open **AWS Billing Console → Budgets**.\n2. Click **Create budget → Cost budget**.\n3. Set a soft limit (for example **$5**).\n4. Add your email.\n5. Save.\n\nYou’ll get a warning when costs hit 80 %, 90 %, and 100 % of that limit.\n\n## 2. Turn On the Free-Tier Usage Alert\n\n* Go to **Billing Console → Free Tier → Sign Up for Alerts**.\n* AWS emails you when you hit **85 %** of any free-tier quota.\n* The message shows which resource is climbing so you can fix it early.\n\n## 3. Use the Pricing Calculator\n\n* Visit the **AWS Pricing Calculator** (just search the term).\n* Add the services you plan to run.\n* **Always include data transfer out.**\n* Compare regions; some cost half as much.\n\n## 4. Keep It Simple for Side Projects\n\nNeed Low-Cost Path Static portfolio **S3 + CloudFront** or GitHub Pages Small dynamic site **AWS Lightsail** ($3.50/mo starter bundle) API that needs compute **t3.micro** behind **CloudFront** or an **API Gateway + Lambda** combo Occasional private subnet internet Small **t3.nano NAT instance** you turn off when done\n\nLightsail is easier for beginners because it has flat pricing and bundles data transfer in the monthly fee.\n\n## 5. Automate Your Clean-Up\n\n* Write a tiny **Lambda** that deletes unattached volumes and IPs on a schedule.\n* Or run AWS’s free **Instance Scheduler** solution from the Marketplace — it stops dev instances at night and over weekends.\n\n## A Personal Bill-Fight Example\n\nAfter my surprise $42 bill, I made three changes:\n\n1. **Moved my static content** to S3 + CloudFront. That dropped outbound data costs from ~$30 to under $2.\n2. **Replaced the NAT Gateway** with a t3.nano NAT instance that I start only during deployments. Monthly NAT cost fell from $10 to about 80 cents.\n3. **Enabled budget alerts** at $5, $10, and $20. Now I get an email long before anything goes wild.\n\nMy next month’s bill? **$4.23** — less than the price of a coffee.\n\n# FAQs You might be thinking of….\n\n## Is AWS Free Tier Really Free?\n\nIt’s free *inside the limits*: 750 hours of t2.micro or t3.micro compute, 1 GB of data out, certain S3 and Lambda amounts, and so on. Go outside those lines and charges start.\n\n## How Do I Avoid AWS Surprise Bills?\n\n* Use the **Pricing Calculator** before launching.\n* **Set budget alerts** on day one.\n* Turn off or delete anything you’re not using.\n* Monitor **data transfer out** — the largest hidden fee.\n\n## Why Are NAT Gateways So Expensive?\n\nBecause AWS charges by the hour **and** by the gigabyte, and they never go idle. If you forget about them, the meter keeps running.\n\n## Can I Run a Free Portfolio on AWS?\n\nYes. Put your site in an S3 bucket and add a CloudFront distribution. Configure Route 53 for the domain (Route 53 costs ~$0.50 monthly plus 50 cents per million queries). Stay under 1 GB of data out and it’s nearly free.","content_type":"blog","source_url":"https://medium.com/@pranavpurohit73/the-hidden-costs-of-awss-free-tier-no-one-talks-about-80be49189c55?source=rss-e56284f41ca1------2","author":"","user_id":"","team_id":"team_1"},{"title":"Is Kubernetes really overkill or worth it ?","content":"# Is Kubernetes really overkill or worth it ?\n\n# What is Kubernetes ?\n\nYou can think kubernetes as a conductor for your containers running your servers. Kubernetes is like a big brain who controls everything which is required to manage your server containers like restarting your containers, scaling them up, balancing the load, etc.\n\n# When Does Kubernetes really helps ?\n\nIt will really help you when you really need it’s superpowers. For example, if you are running many microservices or processes that must run together but scale them independently. So, now in this case kubernetes can be a game changer. But How ?. So now that your each microservice is running on seperate container and managed by the kubernetes and if your startup is expecting an explosive growth or unpredictably large volume of traffic at any given time but don’t worry you got K8s to hold your back. Yes you heard it right !. In this case the kubernetes’ auto-scaling abilities will scale the perticularly microservices container according to the specific need of it. And it’s power to self heal will keep the container live and available at any given point of time. You might go with kubernetes if your startup falls in the below conditions.\n\n1. Rapid Scaling:- If you are expecting a rapid growth in your startup’s popularity or some sudden spikes in user base So in this case K8s auto-scaling pods and nodes are seamless. You can take example of Tic-Toc or any live streaming services which can get any spike, any time.\n2. Multi-Cloud Setup:- If you want to avoid a vendor lock-in then you know that Kubernetes can run on AWS, GCP, Azure, and even Raspberry Pis. For example startups like Spotify use kubernetes to deploy servers across different cloud providers.\n3. Resilience Required:- As kuberentes offers self heal so if any container gets down then it will replace it with another healthy container. No more 3 AM calls to reboot the server!.\n4. Multiple Microservices:- If your app is very lossy coupled and have like 50 microservices like payment processing, real-time analysis…, etc. Then K8s simplify load balancing and rolling updates.\n\n# When it really becomes overkill ?\n\nMany early stage startups think that they should use Kubernetes because it provides various features. Wait! It is way more you need. Let me explain you how ?. If your startup is based on a monolithic application or maybe 2 or 3 microservices coupled tightly, which can be managed on a single server then what will the use of all the feature provided by the kubernetes ?. Honestly it will waste your team’s time and effort to manage the cluster and server because it becomes little complex and takes little extra time and efforts by handling all the different setup it requires.\n\n## Please don’t use K8s if your Startup falls in any one of this situation mentioned below:-\n\n1. Small team and small app:- If your code base is simple or you have 1 or 2 microservices.\n2. No Kubernetes expert:- If you don’t have any expert in your team who really knows K8s inside out.\n3. Still iterating:- If your startup is not mature and still trying to figure out your main feature.\n\n# The Cost Trap\n\nWith great powers comes great cost! Yes you heard it right. Even a simplest and smallest K8s cluster like a 3 control plane nodes plus worker nodes can bill you hundreds of dollars per month on AWS or GCP. And this is before you add load balancers, storage, or extra services. Beside this you should not forget continuous upgrades, monitoring, security patches, etc. So finally managing K8 clusters will end up eating a lot of time, efforts and $s.\n\n# Moral of the story !\n\nNo doubt Kubernetes is a powerful tool but it is not mandatory for every startup specially the early age startups. If you genuinelly nee multi-service scaling and high uptime and also your team have expertise and the budget to afford and manage complex kubernets clusters then it might make sennse. Otherwise, stick to simpler platforms those let you ship features feaster so that you can focus on solving your customer’s problems. Remember you can adopt kubernetes later anytime when ever you feel like or genuinely need it.","content_type":"blog","source_url":"https://medium.com/@pranavpurohit73/is-kubernetes-really-overkill-or-worth-it-036460621230?source=rss-e56284f41ca1------2","author":"","user_id":"","team_id":"team_1"},{"title":"How ChatGPT-5 is Revolutionizing Terraform Code for DevOps Teams","content":"# How ChatGPT-5 is Revolutionizing Terraform Code for DevOps Teams\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe integration of generative AI into DevOps workflows has transformed how infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools like Terraform are used. With the release of **ChatGPT-5**, DevOps teams are now leveraging its advanced capabilities to automate, optimize, and scale cloud infrastructure management. This blog explores how ChatGPT-5 is reshaping Terraform workflows, drawing insights from real-world use cases, technical benchmarks, and best practices observed in viral Medium articles and industry-leading resources.\n\n# The Evolution of AI in IaC: From ChatGPT-3 to ChatGPT-5\n\nEarlier iterations of ChatGPT (e.g., GPT-3.5) demonstrated promise in generating Terraform snippets but faced limitations like outdated syntax, version mismatches, and limited context awareness 110. For instance, users often had to manually adjust parameters like `terraformWorkingDirectory` or update provider versions due to training data cuts in .\n\n**ChatGPT-5** addresses these gaps with:\n\n1. **Real-time knowledge updates**, including the latest Terraform providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and HCL syntax.\n2. **Context-aware code generation**, reducing errors in module dependencies and security policies.\n3. **Multi-step problem-solving**, such as debugging plan/apply errors and suggesting fixes .\n\n# Key Use Cases of ChatGPT-5 in Terraform Workflows\n\n# 1. Accelerating Code Generation\n\nChatGPT-5 can generate production-ready Terraform templates for complex architectures in seconds. For example:\n\n* **Secure VPCs with Subnets, NACLs, and IAM Policies**: By prompting, “Generate a Terraform module for an AWS VPC with private/public subnets, NAT gateways, and least-privilege IAM roles,” DevOps teams receive compliant code with embedded security best practices .\n* **Multi-Cloud Deployments**: Cross-platform templates (e.g., AWS Lambda + Azure Functions) are now feasible with minimal manual tweaking .\n\n# 2. Debugging and Optimization\n\nWhen a pipeline fails due to a Terraform plan error, ChatGPT-5 analyzes logs to pinpoint issues like state locking conflicts or missing provider plugins. For instance, it can:\n\n* Suggest adding `terraform init` to YAML pipelines .\n* Recommend version constraints (e.g., `azurerm >= 3.0`) to resolve compatibility issues .\n\n# 3. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing\n\nChatGPT-5 automates the creation of **readable docs** and **runbooks** by parsing Terraform modules. One team reduced onboarding time by 40% using AI-generated architecture diagrams and variable descriptions .\n\n# 4. Security and Compliance\n\nBy training ChatGPT-5 on internal policies, teams enforce guardrails like:\n\n* Blocking public S3 buckets.\n* Enabling encryption for EBS volumes.\n* Generating SOC2-compliant audit trails .\n\n# 5. Legacy Code Modernization\n\nFor organizations with outdated Terraform v0.11 code, ChatGPT-5 refactors modules to v1.6+ syntax, replaces deprecated functions (e.g., `template_file`), and migrates state files to remote backends .\n\n# Best Practices for Maximizing ChatGPT-5’s Value\n\n1. **Precision in Prompts**:\n\n* Weak: *“Create a Terraform module for Kubernetes.”*\n* Strong: *“Generate a Terraform module for EKS with Fargate profiles, OIDC integration, and autoscaling policies for a dev environment.”* .\n\n**Validation Pipelines**:\n\n1. **Precision in Prompts**:\n\n* Integrate ChatGPT-5’s output into CI/CD steps like `terraform validate`, `checkov`, and `tfsec` to catch misconfigurations early .\n\n**Contextual Training**:\n\n* Fine-tune the model with internal codebases and naming conventions to improve relevance.\n\n**Ethical Guardrails**:\n\n* Avoid sharing secrets or proprietary code. Use anonymized examples for troubleshooting .\n\n# Challenges and Limitations\n\n* **Over-Reliance on AI**: Teams risk skill atrophy if ChatGPT-5 becomes a “black box.” Pair AI-generated code with peer reviews 15.\n* **Edge Cases**: Rare AWS services (e.g., Ground Station) may lack sufficient training data, requiring manual intervention 13.\n* **Cost Management**: While ChatGPT-5 suggests cost-optimized architectures (e.g., spot instances), actual cloud spend still requires FinOps oversight .\n\n# The Future of AI-Driven IaC\n\nIndustry leaders predict ChatGPT-5 will evolve into a **collaborative assistant** that:\n\n* Automatically updates Terraform versions during `init`.\n* Generates PR descriptions and changelogs.\n* Simulates `terraform plan` outcomes using predictive analytics 813.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nChatGPT-5 is not a replacement for DevOps engineers but a **force multiplier** that eliminates grunt work and fosters innovation. By adopting it strategically — validating outputs, refining prompts, and retaining human expertise — teams can deploy infrastructure faster, safer, and at unprecedented scale.\n\n**Ready to experiment?** Start with low-risk modules (e.g., S3 buckets) and gradually expand to complex workflows. The future of IaC is here, and it’s collaborative.\n\n*For further reading, explore these viral resources:*[Jenkins in 2025: The Cockroach of DevOps That Refuses to Die](/@pranavpurohit73/jenkins-in-2025-the-cockroach-of-devops-that-refuses-to-die-2aa27fd21c4a)  \n[EC2 t2.micro Really Free or a Scam? and How It Really Works](/@pranavpurohit73/ec2-t2-micro-for-beginners-whats-free-what-s-not-and-how-it-really-works-f321c8d973fa)  \n[How to Host a Website on AWS S3: A Step-by-Step Guide](/@pranavpurohit73/how-to-host-a-website-on-aws-s3-a-step-by-step-guide-a49dcd087e91)","content_type":"blog","source_url":"https://medium.com/@pranavpurohit73/how-chatgpt-5-is-revolutionizing-terraform-code-for-devops-teams-e1a78596c2cb?source=rss-e56284f41ca1------2","author":"","user_id":"","team_id":"team_1"},{"title":"Jenkins in 2025: The Cockroach of DevOps That Refuses to Die","content":"# Jenkins in 2025: The Cockroach of DevOps That Refuses to Die\n\n🚀 The Un-killable Legend, Jenkins is the **cockroach of DevOps tools**.\n\nNo matter how many “modern” alternatives pop up — GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, you name it — Jenkins keeps surviving.\n\nAnnoying? **Maybe.**  \nImpressive? **Absolutely.**\n\nThink of Jenkins like that **old Nokia 3310 phone** — clunky, outdated, but somehow still working after being dropped down a flight of stairs.\n\nMeanwhile, your fancy new CI/CD tool?

It’s not just for storing files — S3 can serve static websites like portfolios, blogs, or even startup landing pages with ease. As an AWS cloud engineer, I’ve set this up for clients and seen it save time and money. Let’s walk through how to do it, step-by-step, and why it’s a game-changer for anyone dipping into cloud hosting.\n\n# Why S3 for Website Hosting?\n\nS3 (Simple Storage Service) is AWS’s go-to for object storage, but it doubles as a static website host. Here’s why it’s worth your time:\n\n* **Cost-Effective:** Pay only for what you use — pennies for small sites.\n* **Scalable:** Handles traffic spikes without breaking a sweat.\n* **Simple:** No servers to manage — just upload and go.\n* **Secure:** Integrates with AWS tools like IAM and CloudFront.\n\nStatic sites (HTML, CSS, JS) are perfect for this — think portfolios, documentation, or marketing pages. Dynamic sites with backends? You’ll need more (e.g., EC2 or Lambda). But for now, let’s host something static on S3.\n\n# Step 1: Set Up Your S3 Bucket\n\nFirst, you need an S3 bucket — think of it as your website’s storage box.\n\n1. **Log into AWS Console:** Head to the S3 dashboard.\n2. **Create a Bucket:**\n\n* Click “Create Bucket.”\n* Name it something unique (e.g., my-startup-site-2025). AWS requires globally unique names, so get creative.\n* Choose a region (e.g., us-east-1 for low latency if targeting the US).\n* Leave defaults for now, but uncheck “Block all public access” (we’ll secure it later).\n\nPress on “Create Bucket”\n\n3. **Configure The Bucket:** Make sure to configure the bucket as shown in image below\n\n4. **Enable Static Website Hosting:**\n\n* Open your bucket, go to the “Properties” tab.\n\nProperties Tab\n\n* Scroll to “Static website hosting,” click “Edit.”\n\n* Select “Enable,” set “Host a static website.”\n* Enter index.html as the Index Document (your homepage).\n\nSave this configuration\n\nYour bucket’s ready — but it’s empty. Time to add files.\n\n# Step 2: Upload Your Website Files\n\nYou’ll need a basic static site. For this, let’s assume you’ve got an index.html and maybe some CSS/JS.\n\n1. **Create a Simple Site (Optional):**\n\n* Here’s a quick index.html:\n* `<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>My Cloud Site</title> </head> <body> <h1>Welcome to My S3-Hosted Site!</h1> <p>Powered by AWS S3.</p> </body> </html>`\n* Save it locally.\n\n2. **Upload to S3:**\n\n* In your bucket, click “Upload.”\n* Drag in index.html (and any CSS/JS files).\n* Click “Upload” to finish.\n\n3. **Set Permissions:**\n\n* By default, files aren’t public. Select index.html, click “Actions” > “Make public via ACL.”\n* Or, apply a bucket policy (more on this next).\n\nYour files are up, but without proper access, no one can see them. Let’s fix that.\n\n# Step 3: Configure Public Access\n\nS3 is secure by default, so you need to explicitly allow public access for your site.\n\nClick on Edit under Bucket Polic\n\n1. **Add a Bucket Policy:**\n\n* Go to the “Permissions” tab in your bucket.\n* Under “Bucket Policy,” click “Edit.”\n* Paste this policy (replace my-startup-site-2025 with your bucket name):\n* {  \n   “Version”: “2012–10–17”,  \n   “Statement”: [  \n   {  \n   “Sid”: “PublicReadGetObject”,  \n   “Effect”: “Allow”,  \n   “Principal”: “\\*”,  \n   “Action”: “s3:GetObject”,  \n   “Resource”: “arn:aws:s3:::my-edtech-site-2025/\\*”  \n   }  \n   ]  \n  }\n* Save it. This lets anyone view your files.\n\n2. **Test It:**\n\n* Copy the static website endpoint from the “Properties” tab.\n* Paste it in your browser. You should see “Welcome to My S3-Hosted Site!”\n\nIf it works, congrats — your site’s live! If not, double-check the policy and file permissions.\n\n# Step 4: Add a Custom Domain (Optional)\n\nThat S3 URL isn’t pretty. Want [www.mystartup.com](http://www.myedtechsite.com) instead? Here’s how:\n\n1. **Register a Domain:** Use Route 53, GoDaddy, or any registrar.\n2. **Set Up Route 53:** In AWS, go to Route 53 > “Hosted Zones,” create one for your domain. Note the NS records and update them at your registrar.\n\n**3. Link to S3:** In Route 53, create an A record. Alias it to your S3 bucket’s endpoint (select it from the dropdown).\n\n**4. Update S3:** Rename your bucket to match your domain (e.g., [www.mystartup.com)](http://www.myedtechsite.com)) and repeat the setup.\n\nThis takes ~24 hours to propagate, but it’s worth it for branding.\n\n# Step 5: Boost with CloudFront (Optional)\n\nS3 alone is great, but CloudFront (AWS’s CDN) makes it faster and more secure.\n\n1. **Create a Distribution:** Go to CloudFront, click “Create Distribution.”\n\n* Set your S3 bucket as the origin (use the static website endpoint).\n* Leave defaults, but set “Default Root Object” to index.html.\n\n2. **Deploy:** Takes 10–15 minute. You’ll get a CloudFront URL (example, d123.cloudfront.net).\n\n**3. Link Domain:** Update Route 53 to alias CloudFront instead of S3.\n\nNow your site loads lightning-fast globally.\n\n# Cost Breakdown\n\n* **S3:** ~$0.023/GB stored + $0.09/GB transferred. A small site might cost $1–2/month.\n* **CloudFront:** Free tier covers 1 TB of data/month — plenty for starters.\n* **Domain:** ~$10–15/year via Route 53 or others.\n\nCompare that to traditional hosting — S3’s a steal.\n\n# Pro Tips from the Trenches\n\n* **Organize Files:** Use folders (e.g., /css, /js) for clean URLs like myedtechsite.com/css/style.css.\n* **Error Pages:** In S3 properties, set a custom error.html for 404s.\n* **Versioning:** Enable it in S3 to rollback mistakes.\n* **Security:** Use IAM roles or CloudFront signed URLs if parts need restricting.\n\nI once helped an startup host a course landing page on S3. Traffic spiked during enrollment — S3 handled it, no sweat, for under $5/month.\n\n# Why This Matters for a Startup\n\nFor cloud EdTech brands, S3 hosting is a no-brainer. It’s cheap enough for MVPs, scalable for growth, and pairs with AWS tools like Lambda or DynamoDB if you later add interactivity. Plus, it’s a great story for your LinkedIn: “How I Hosted an EdTech Site for Pennies.”\n\nReady to try it? Grab that index.html, fire up S3, and see your site live in under an hour. Questions?

Sign me up!” The EC2 t2.micro instance is one of the biggest draws for new users like me back then — it’s part of AWS’s Free Tier, promising 750 hours a month of computer power at no cost for your first year. It sounded perfect for learning, testing ideas, or even running a small website. But here’s what I learned the hard way: “free” isn’t as simple as it seems. As an AWS cloud engineer now, I want to walk you through the t2.micro in plain language — how it works, what you’re really getting, and why you might end up paying even if it says “free.” Let’s dive in step by step.\n\n## What’s the Deal With t2.micro Pricing?\n\nAWS says the t2.micro is free for 750 hours a month for 12 months after you create your account. That’s about 31 days of nonstop use each month (since a month is usually 720–744 hours). Imagine it like a coupon: one tiny computer, running all the time, no charge — for a year. Cool, right? But there’s more to the story:\n\n* **The Free Year Ends:** After 12 months, the free ride stops. Then, it costs about $0.0116 per hour (in the US East region) — that’s around $8-$9 a month if you keep it on 24/7. Not bad, but not free anymore.\n* **Watch Your Hours:** The 750 hours is for one t2.micro. Start two of them for half the month? You’ll use up your 750 hours fast, and AWS will charge you for the extra right away — even in your free year.\n* **Sneaky Extras:** The “free” part is just for the computer itself. Other things — like sending data out to the internet or adding more storage — cost money from day one.\n\nI once set up a t2.micro to mess around with a little app. I thought, “It’s free, no worries!” Then I got a $5 bill because I sent some files to my laptop over the internet. Lesson learned: AWS gives you a free taste, but it’s not an all-you-can-eat buffet.\n\n## CPU Credits: The Power Puzzle\n\nThe t2.micro isn’t a full-strength computer — it’s more like a scooter with a small gas tank. It uses something called CPU credits to decide how much power you get:\n\n* **Normal Speed:** It runs at 10% of a full CPU — like a slow jog. That’s fine for tiny tasks, like a basic website with a few visitors.\n* **Earning Credits:** Every hour, it collects 6 credits, up to a max of 144 (that’s 24 hours of saving up). One credit lets it sprint at full speed (100% CPU) for one minute.\n* **Sprinting:** Need to do something big, like crunching numbers or handling lots of users? It’ll use those credits to go fast — until they’re gone. Then it slows back to 10%.\n\nThink of it like this: You save up 144 credits by letting it rest for a day. Then you run a big job — full speed for 2 hours and 24 minutes — and your tank’s empty. After that, it crawls until more credits trickle in. For small stuff, it’s great. But push it too hard, and you’ll feel stuck. There’s a way to pay extra for unlimited speed, but that’s not in the Free Tier.\n\n## Networking: Connecting Your t2.micro\n\nYour t2.micro needs to talk to the world — like sending data to your phone or getting updates. Here’s how that works:\n\n* **Data Coming In:** Free. Upload files or send stuff to your t2.micro — no charge.\n* **Data Going Out:** The Free Tier gives you 1 GB free per month to send out. After that, it’s about $0.09 per GB. A small website might stay under 1 GB, but if you’re sharing videos or big files? That adds up quick.\n* **Internet Address:** Your t2.micro gets a public address (like a phone number) to connect online. The Free Tier covers this while it’s running, but stop it and keep the address? You’ll pay a tiny fee — $0.005 per hour.\n\nI once stopped my t2.micro but forgot to release its address. A few bucks later, I realized “free” doesn’t cover everything. Networking is a must, but it’s a cost to watch.\n\n## CPU Credit Balance: Your Speedometer\n\nThe CPU credit balance is like a fuel gauge for your t2.micro. AWS’s CloudWatch tool shows you how many credits you have:\n\n* **Building Up:** If your t2.micro is chilling (using less than 10% CPU), it saves credits — 6 per hour.\n* **Using Them:** Go over 10%, and it starts burning credits. At full speed, they vanish fast — 1 credit per minute.\n* **Running Dry:** Hit zero credits, and you’re stuck at that slow 10% until more come in.\n\nIt’s like managing a piggy bank. Let it sit, and you’ve got a stash for emergencies. Work it hard, and you’re broke until tomorrow. Newbies need to check this — or your “free” computer might feel useless when you need it most.\n\n## VPC: The Home Your t2.micro Needs\n\nYou can’t just drop a t2.micro into the cloud — it needs a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), a private space to live in. Think of it as a fenced yard:\n\n* **What’s a VPC?** It’s a network you set up in AWS. It has “rooms” (subnets) and a “gate” (Internet Gateway) so your t2.micro can connect to the internet.\n* **Do I Have One?** AWS gives you a default VPC when you start, but you’ll still pick a subnet (a smaller section) when launching your t2.micro.\n* **Steps to Launch:** You make a VPC (or use the default), add an Internet Gateway, set up rules for traffic, and place your t2.micro inside. It’s like building a house before moving in.\n* **Cost?** The VPC itself is free, but extras — like a tool to hide your t2.micro’s address (a NAT Gateway) — cost money, around $0.045 per hour plus data fees.\n\nMy first mistake? I added a NAT Gateway and forgot to turn it off — $30 gone. You need a VPC, but keep it simple to stay free.\n\n## The Truth: “Free” Comes With a Catch\n\nThe t2.micro Free Tier is awesome for starting out — learning AWS, hosting a small site, or playing with code. But it’s not free forever. After your first year, you’ll pay $8-$10 a month just to keep it running. Even before then, little things — like sending too much data out (over 1 GB), keeping an unused address, or adding storage (about $0.10 per GB per month) — add up. I got a 22,000 rupees bill once for leaving Amazon Rekognition on by accident. The Free Tier didn’t save me there, and it won’t save you from every slip-up.\n\nSo, try the t2.micro — it’s a great sandbox. Just know it’s a teaser, not a gift. Keep an eye on your credits, your data, and your VPC setup. AWS is amazing, but it’s built to make money — sooner or later, you’ll pay something.

But don’t you think you can really explore great things in your locality itself so quickly go on LocalEyes and check out your locality with new reality.\n\n1 NAHARGARH — Nahargarh Fort stands on the edge of the Aravalli Hills, overlooking the city of Jaipur in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Along with Amer Fort and Jaigarh Fort, Nahargarh once formed a strong defense ring for the city. The fort was originally named Sudershangarh, but it became known as Nahargarh, which means ‘abode of tigers. The popular belief is that Nahar here stands for Nahar Singh Bhomia, whose spirit haunted the place and obstructed the construction of the fort. Nahar’s spirit was pacified by building a temple in his memory within the fort, which thus became known by his name.\n\n2 AMER FORT [AKA AMBER PALACE] — Amer Fort is probably the most well-known tourist sight in Jaipur to visit. It’s big, it’s beautiful and you could easily spend a whole day exploring this wonderful fortress (not that you have the time to of course!). Recently the great JLF was here at Amber Fort click [here](https://localeyes.in/app/post/local/iVBGHWGyYEH9G93dNKpR) to see how JLF took place at Amber Fort\n\nThis photo is clicked by me :)\n\nMoving ahead quickly, You can then visit -\n\n3 JAL MAHAL — Jalmehal is a place you can have a quick visit like site seeing. There you can also have a nice and memorable photograph.\n\nThis photo is clicked by me :)\n\nNow after visiting Nahargarh, Amber Fort, and Jalmehal, you can have some rest, and then in the evening, you can plan to visit.\n\n4 ALBERT HALL MUSEUM — This is one of the oldest museums in all of Rajasthan and is also the state museum for all of Rajasthan.

It feels… off. 🤨 That’s because it follows Material Design. But iOS has its own design language.\n\nIf you’re building for Apple users, give them something that actually looks like it belongs — enter: `CupertinoRadio`.\n\n# The Solution: CupertinoRadio + CupertinoListTile\n\nLet’s create a clean, native-feeling option selector.\n\n```\nenum SingingCharacter { lafayette, jefferson }\n```\n\n```\nSingingCharacter _character = SingingCharacter.lafayette;\n```\n\nThen build your UI using both `CupertinoRadio` and `CupertinoListTile` for that native-feel combo:\n\n```\nCupertinoListSection(  \n  header: const Text('onChanged'),  \n  children: <CupertinoListTile>[  \n    CupertinoListTile(  \n      title: const Text('Marquis de Lafayette'),  \n      leading: CupertinoRadio<SingingCharacter>(  \n        value…\n```","content_type":"blog","source_url":"https://nurobyte.medium.com/youre-still-using-basic-radio-buttons-in-flutter-here-s-the-ios-native-way-506f84d8ce25?source=rss-76c4415cada2------2","author":"","user_id":"","team_id":"team_2"},{"title":"Flutter Web Hot Reload: Instantly See Changes in the Browser","content":"# Flutter Web Hot Reload: Instantly See Changes in the Browser\n\n**Imagine this:**  \n You’re building a Flutter app, running it in Chrome.

Just pure, uninterrupted development flow.\n\nWith **Flutter 3.32**, that dream is now a reality. The long-awaited **Hot Reload for Web** is here — currently experimental, but already making waves.\n\n# Why Flutter Web Hot Reload is a Game Changer\n\nFor years, **hot reload** has been one of Flutter’s superpowers on mobile and desktop. But on the web, developers have had to deal with **slower full reloads**, often taking several seconds and resetting app state. That’s not ideal when you’re iterating on UI or debugging layout issues.\n\nNow, with **web hot reload**, everything changes:\n\n* **Faster feedback loop** — Save your changes and see them instantly.\n* **Browser-native workflows** — Just like CSS/JS live reload.\n* **Better debugging** — Test responsiveness and layout directly in the browser.\n\n# How to Enable Flutter Web Hot Reload","content_type":"blog","source_url":"https://nurobyte.medium.com/flutter-web-hot-reload-instantly-see-changes-in-the-browser-46ede2a95b72?source=rss-76c4415cada2------2","author":"","user_id":"","team_id":"team_2"},{"title":"From Zero to SQLite: Storing Data Locally in Flutter Made Simple","content":"# From Zero to SQLite: Storing Data Locally in Flutter Made Simple\n\n# 📖 A Beginner’s Guide to Integrating SQLite with Flutter — with a Real UI Example!\n\nWhen I first started learning Flutter, I was amazed by how fast and beautiful mobile apps could be built.

Impeller Is a Game Changer\n\nFlutter now uses **Impeller** as the default rendering engine, replacing Skia. It uses Vulkan/Metal under the hood, dramatically reducing shader jank and **boosting FPS even on mid-range devices**.\n\nEnable it in `pubspec.yaml`:\n\n```\nflutter:  \n  enable-impeller: true\n```\n\n# 2. Use `const` Like Your Life Depends on It\n\nDon’t underestimate `const`. It tells Flutter not to rebuild widgets\n\n```\nconst Text('Fast and Efficient!');\n```\n\n# 3.
